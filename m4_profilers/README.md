# Profilers and Case Studies
## Introduction to profiling, Optimization case studies

* Profilers (PyTorch, web, GPU, general)

## Specializations

* Training a neural network
* Optimizing a neural network for inference
* Running Yolo
* Optimizing a point cloud renderer
* Optimizing a path tracer

## \*Exercise

Try out the profilers relevant to your own system with some sample programs.  
Now try it with some of your own code from before you started on the guide!

## S\*Group discussion and presentation
Pick one of the following topics.  
Read and understand it, then present and discuss the topic with one or more other people.  
Preferably classmates.

* Packing bits for atomic operators
* Inverse depth buffers
* Bittricks, packing normals and colors
* Morton codes / Z-order curves, tiling and GPU textures
* Calculating compression precision in a lossy point cloud compression scheme
* DLSS
* Real-Time Texture Decompression and Upsampling
* 2:4 sparsity with Tensor Cores
