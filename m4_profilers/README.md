# Profilers and Case Studies
## Introduction to profiling, Optimization case studies

* Profilers (PyTorch, web, GPU, general)

## Specializations

* Training a neural network
* Optimizing a neural network for inference
* Running Yolo
* Optimizing a point cloud renderer
* Optimizing a path tracer

## (Exercise)

* (Try out the profilers relevant to your own system with some sample programs.)
