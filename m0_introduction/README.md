# Introduction
Had to find material specifically suited for python people.  
There are so many things to keep track of and most systems hide these things from the user.
It can be hard to reason about what is going on.
You either have to be a systems programmer or be a python person spoken to as
if you are a systems programmer.
The guide has been optimized to be an iterative process, taking you by the hand,
speaking to you at the level at which you are following it and trying not to overwhelm the user.  
The guide will give you enough context that you can hopefully be motivated as
to why you should care about learning what is in the guide.
The guide tries to not make you panic or be overburdened by iteratively expanding the content.  
The guide also acknowledges that some people have different interests.  
As such, portions of the guide will be tailored to people who like deep learning,
people who like computer vision, or computer graphics or some such.
You are more than welcome to read and do all of it, but no one says you have to do anything.
If you just follow along the path that is relevant to you, that is fine too.
In any case, the guide tries to maximize the return-on-investment of your time vs. how much you learn.

You should take the leap and learn about these complex systems as it can have wide reaching consequences.  
Lower CO2 emissions, especially important at scale or if you are training machine learning models for a long time.  
Faster code, get your results faster, make more interactive systems.  
Easier to understand, reason and strategize about systems and other peoples' code.  

Code will also be provided. This will be mostly in Rust with wgpu and a bit of python where needed.

It is assumed that the user does not jump throughout the guide, as some details are spaced
out along the way, to not overwhelm the user.

## Why should you use this material
How to reason about the black box.  
A testing session, a cooking course.  
An assortment of tricks for the performance minded adventurer.

## How to use the materials as a teacher
If you are a teacher who wants to make use of this material, feel free to use the
[course site](https://absorensen.github.io/real-time-visual-and-machine-learning-systems/).  
The course in site focuses teaching real-time systems for deep learners and visual systems programmers.  
It allocates half of 15 days to going through the material in the guide and the
other half to making a project relevant to the students' specialization.  
It is designed to move through lots of different topics very quickly with a
handful of varying exercises.
The student is to then reach back and explore the topics relevant to their
project in greater detail.  
The breadth of topics is quite wide, and each student should be expected to
pass an exam in each topic.  
In most cases they might remember that a thing exists and that they can
search for it.  
The thing they hopefully all learn is how to reason about performance, systems
design and that getting your hands dirty can be fun and invigorating.

## Levels
Which level is for who and what does it require

### Level 1
Unsure whether to invest the time and effort.
Each module is boiled down to approximately 2 pages of reading. 
Reading all of the material should take at most an afternoon.

### Level 2
At this level you might be a comfortable programmer in Python.
It is expected that you checkout the repository and try out the code on your own laptop.
Don't worry, it does not require an Nvidia GPU to run on your laptop.
There will be Rust code, but it will be simplified Rust code exactly for teaching  
people who have never programmed C/C++ or Rust before.
You are expected to run the code and perhaps change a few variables.  
If you are a systems programmer, you should be able to move through this level quite quickly.  
This level does not take into account any module, section, page or info box with a '+' in front of the name.  
These constitute level 3. You are still welcome to read them of course, but  
the language and code are a bit more advanced and it might overwhelm you.

### Level 3
At this level it is expected that you have experience with C/C++/Rust and that you have tried programming a GPU.  
If you haven't done any of these things, that is perfectly fine, but it might take some more significant effort on your part.
If you have previously done level 2, you should be ok.

### Level 4
At this level everything expected at level 3 is expected, as well as you doing most or
all of the exercises. This is mostly for people doing a course version or who
REALLY want to learn all the guide has to offer.
