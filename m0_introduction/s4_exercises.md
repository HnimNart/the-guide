# üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Exercises
In order to get a hang of the basic of Rust I recommend doing [Advent of Code][1]
problems until you feel comfortable moving forward.

You won't be confronted much with the borrow checker in these small problems. To get better practice structure,
smart pointers, dynamic dispatch and traits, I recommend moving on to doing [Ray Tracing in One Weekend][2] in Rust.
There is a code snippet which shows your image on screen instead of writing it to file in
```m1_memory_hierarchies::code::image_on_screen```.

Once you have completed this part 1 out of 3, I suggest modifying the resulting code in the following ways -

* Remove the use of ```dyn```. (Hint: Use enums)
* Remove the use of smart pointers.
(Hint: My solution was to use indices and a geometry service provided by dependency injection)
* Parallelize computation of pixels through ```rayon```.
