# 3️⃣ Measuring Performance

What and how.
Lots of hows.
Some of them give access to measuring different whats. 

## What to measure

* Timing
* Variance
* Multiple samples
* Where to measure
* Profile from slowest to fastest
* Transfer bound
* Memory bound
* Compute bound

## How to measure

### Timing in Code
Time and print
Measure in a loop
Add variance
Plotting
Benchmark with Rust?
Timing/Benchmarking as part of CI

### Task Manager
Easy on Windows, what to do on Linux and iOS?

### Profilers
See the next section, very much optional, and it is mainly for when you can't figure out what is the issue with
the other two tools.
