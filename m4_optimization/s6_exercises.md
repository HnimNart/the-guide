Try out the profilers relevant to your own system with some sample programs.  
Now try it with some of your own code from before you started on the guide!

## üß¨ Group discussion and presentation

* Morton codes / Z-order curves, tiling and GPU textures
* Calculating compression precision in a lossy point cloud compression scheme
* DLSS

## Optimizing Inference
Find a suitable model and inference library.  
Perform inference.  
Optimize the model and inference process.  
Can you do inferencing on one thread,  
training on another and swap in the new model?
