# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Exercises
Try out the profilers relevant to your own system with some sample programs.  
Now try it with some of your own code from before you started on the guide!

## Setting Up a Profiler
Find and setup a profiler that works ON YOUR SYSTEM

* Does it work with Rust?
* Which metrics can you get out of it?
* Can you see what is happening on the GPU?
* Do you need a different profiler to see what is going on on the GPU?
* Can you see L2 cache hits/misses?
* Can it show you the hot spots in your code?

## üß¨ Group discussion and presentation
Pick one of the following topics.  
Read and understand it, then present and discuss the topic with one or more other people.  
Preferably classmates.

* Inverse depth buffers
* Bit tricks, atomic operators, packing normals and colors
* Morton codes / Z-order curves, tiling and GPU textures
* PyTorch 2.0 Compiler
* Graph Sampling
* DLSS
* Real-Time Texture Decompression and Upsampling
* 2:4 sparsity with Tensor Cores
