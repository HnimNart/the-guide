# Concepts in Parallelism

* Threads
* Async
* Events
* Mutex
* Atomic
* Channels
* Data parallelism, work stealing - rayon
* Data parallelism, non-work stealing - crossbeam
* 3️⃣ GPU - 3️⃣ Warp Shuffling and Distributed Shared Memory 3️⃣ SPIR-V & GLSL/HLSL 3️⃣ Asynchronous memory transfers
* 3️⃣ Branchless programming, branch prediction and pipelines
* 3️⃣ SIMD
* 3️⃣ Sparsity
* 3️⃣ Random Access and Monte Carlo (Gyro Dropout)
* 3️⃣ Sorting
* 3️⃣ Parallel work on graphs
