# 🧬4️⃣ Projects

## How to create real time systems, good frameworks for the different fields and project proposals

* Starting with a simple prototype
* Identify your components
* Single threaded correct implementation -> Testing to avoid regression
* Optimize

## What makes for a good project?

* What is your concept/project?
* Which concepts from the previous material do you think
are relevant to your project and why?
* Preprocessing your data?
* How do you adapt to your chosen/available platform?
* Which libraries did you choose for this problem?
* How fast did you get to your minimum viable product?
* Which steps did you take from there and why?
* How did you determine which parts of your system to optimize?
* What else would you like to do with your system?

## Project Proposals

* Virtual 3D scanner for a point cloud dataset
* EEG system
* Change the latent variables in a network using GUI, optimize the network
* Point cloud renderer
* Real-time style transfer on a web cam feed
* Rendering fractals influenced by a web cam feed
* Eye tracking -> Present to screen and read from web cam ->
feature extraction -> classifier -> intervention signal ->
reading app (Wolfgang Fuhl, PISTOL, fixation detection)
* Bird classification from sound / Real-time classification of sound (Xeno-canto database)
* Who is talking? Real-time classification of sound
* Are you dyslexic? Eye tracking classifier
* Cognitive load tracker - Eyes & pupil dilation and online estimation of
signal strength (pupils vs. sound for the hearing impaired)
