# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Computational Graphs

## Intro to computational graphs - overview of immediate, graph and compiled graph

## What is a graph?
Trees, graphs, pointers, very abstract
## The network we want to support
Linear Layer, ReLU, Softmax, input, output
Linear
f32 only, dtype=f32
## What's in a tensor
Linear memory, sometimes called the raw view
## Data dependencies and control dependencies
Working on a graph
Contatenation (multiple writes to the same node)
## Testing the correctness of the nodes
Testing in Rust
## Inlining
What is inlining
Perspective to kernel fusion
