## Pen & Paper Exercises
### Vector Memory
Write out the stack and heap memory of THIS sequence of vector operations.
You can represent unitialized memory with a *.  
The vector must double its capacity and copy over each element once it gets a push operation while at capacity.
The vector must resize to half its size and copy over each active element once it gets a pop operation while at
quarter capacity.

* Create new vector of capacity 4
* .push(5)
* .push(2)
* .push(1)
* .pop()
* .push(42)
* .push(350)
* .push(1337)
* .push(1)
* .push(2)
* .push(5)
* .push(10)
* .pop()
* .pop()
* .pop()
* .pop()
* .pop()
* .pop()
* .pop()
* .pop()

Barring a few errors here and there this should be a simple exercise. Except.
Are you sure you got all of the undefined (*) values right?

Which common operation could have replaced the last sequence of .pop() operations
in the case where you wouldn't be using the popped values?

### Linearized indexing  
You have an array of dimensions ```MN``` in a linearized array ```data```, write pseudo code that iterates
through all data elements using two for-loops and doubles the value in place.

You have an array of dimensions ```MNK``` in a linearized array ```data```, write pseudo code that iterates
through all data elements using three for-loops and triples the value in place.

### Killing the garbage collector

Where would you add a pointer to hurt garbage collection the most?

Adding which pointer would result in the most nodes not being properly garbage collected?  
If the garbage collector implements cycle detection to depth 2 adding which pointer would break it?
The nodes can't point to themselves.

How could you make this sort of general graph, with very few restrictions, safe for garbage collection?

In the case of the multiply connected nodes, can you come up with a structural solution which allows
us to make arbitrary graphs in a garbage collected setting or safe in a C++/Rust setting?

## Programming
Extend the computational graph with an inplace operation for the ReLU operator (only for the non-fused ReLU)

The following list is sorted by expected complexity - do at least 1

* Add reusable buffers to the computational graph system (for the intermediate activations)
* Implement a shader cached version of the immediate mode GPU operators and add it to the benchmark
* Implement a version of the linear layer functions which uses shared memory and tiling
* Change the ```Tensor2DGPU``` to have switchable access details on its buffers. It should be able to
accomodate some tensors being exclusively read-only. Do you see any performance differences for whether
they are read-only or not?
* Implement the tree reduction version of the sum function and add it to the softmax function.
Also compare the single pass and the tree reduction performance graphs. [Reference](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/files/reduction.pdf)
* Implement a max pooling operator, as well as fusing with ReLU, in all levels and implement tests
* Implement a convolution operator, as well as fusing with ReLU, in all levels and implement tests
