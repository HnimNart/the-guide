# 2️⃣ Building a Computational Graph Compiler
Oneshot receiver/sender
Sum and Max functions wildly inefficient
Currently allocating a staging buffer too much
The graph-loop's amount of transfers are a bit off

## Transfers

## Seeing the GPU memory hierarchy - caches, shared memory and RAM

## Graph compilers and OP codes

## Swapping operators for fused versions
