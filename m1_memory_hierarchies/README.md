# Memory Hierarchies, Computational Graphs and Compilers

## Perspective
What will this module go through. PyTorch, intro and outro perspective

## Why is Memory so important
Where is the memory. Memory is slower than compute.
Some parts of the hierarchy are implicit.

## GPU's
GPU's.

## Expanding the Memory Hierarchy
Memory hierarchies, within and without.
GPU's and virtualization.

## Complex Systems
We are increasingly using sophisticated systems, like JIT-compilers and computational graphs to accelerate.
Graphs for memory movement.
A lot of the same guarantees and analysis we put on to our compute graphs, mirror what we do on the
scale when verifying our programs for correctness. Especially, when parallelising code.
Graph compilers for further optimization.

## Outro Perspective
PyTorch and torch.compile()
