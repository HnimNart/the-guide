# Computational Graphs

## Intro to computational graphs - overview of immediate, graph and compiled graph

## What is a graph?
Trees, graphs, pointers, very abstract
## The network we want to support
Linear Layer, ReLU, Softmax, input, output
Linear
f32 only, dtype=f32
## What's in a tensor
Linear memory, sometimes called the raw view
## Data dependencies and control dependencies
Working on a graph
## Testing the correctness of the nodes
Testing in Rust
## Inlining
What is inlining
Perspective to kernel fusion

## \*Compiler verifications and the restrict keyword
## \*Intermediate representations
## \*Graph representations
## S\*Perspective to render graphs
For graphics
