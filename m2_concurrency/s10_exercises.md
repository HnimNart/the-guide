# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Exercises
Describe the base architecture of the egui-winit-wgpu template. Found in
```m2_concurrency::code::egui-winit-wgpu-template``` or
[online](https://github.com/absorensen/the-guide/tree/main/m2_concurrency/code/egui-winit-wgpu-template).

Which elements are in play? Think back to what you have learned in
this and the previous module. Use words and diagrams!

# üß¨ Descriptions
Pick items worth a total of 3 points or more, write an interpretation of each
item of at least 10 times the number of points lines. So an item worth 2 points
requires a 20 line description.

Suggestions for things to talk about:

* A description of the proposed solution
* Which elements you have learned about in ```m1``` and ```m2``` are at play?
* What performance implications result from the item?
